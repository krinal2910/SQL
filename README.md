# Sales Data Explorer ðŸ“ˆ

Welcome to the Retail Sale Analysis project! embarking on a journey to unravel the mysteries hidden within a treasure trove of SQL data. Get ready for some SQL sorcery and let's make data fun! ðŸ“Šâœ¨

***What's Inside?***

Dive into the world of customer shopping trends with SQL queries. This project dissects a vast dataset, providing insights into shipping preferences, review ratings, customer behaviors, and more. SQL is  wand, and the database is enchanted realm.

***Before You Begin***

Ensure you are equipped with:

- SQL powers (a database with shopping trends data)
- A curious mind for unraveling data stories

***Get Started***


Clone the SQL repository
git clone https://github.com/krinal2910/shopping-trends-sql.git

Fire up the SQL server and execute the queries
- Execute the queries one by one in your SQL environment

***How It Works***

We start by peeling back the layers of our SQL dataset. From deciphering shipping preferences to uncovering purchasing patterns, each SQL query contributes to the narrative. We explore questions like:

- Which shipping types are most commonly chosen by customers?
- What is the overall review rating distribution for all purchases?
- Are there any patterns in review ratings based on the number of previous purchases?
- How many customers make purchases weekly, fortnightly, or monthly?
- Is there a correlation between the frequency of purchases and customer review ratings?
- What are the most and least preferred payment methods among customers?
- How does the preferred payment method vary across different age groups?
- What percentage of purchases have applied discounts?
- Are customers who use promo codes more likely to provide higher review ratings?
- Which locations have the highest and lowest average purchase amounts?
- What is the more likely used payment method for each state?
- How does the average purchase amount differ between subscribed and non-subscribed customers?
- Are subscribed customers more likely to use promo codes?
- What is the average purchase amount for different sizes and items?
- Identify any seasonal trends in customer purchases.
- What are the top-selling products by category?
- What is the distribution of customers by age?
- What is the distribution of customers by gender?
- Which age group makes the highest average purchase amount?
